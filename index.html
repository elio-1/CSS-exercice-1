                    <h4>Pear juice</h4>
                    <p>Pear juice can be made from various types of pears, but not all pears are suitable for juicing. Asian pears are particularly good for juicing as they are juicy and not pulpy, producing a refreshing and delicious juice similar to fresh sugarcane juice. However, other varieties can also be used if Asian pears are not available.</p>
